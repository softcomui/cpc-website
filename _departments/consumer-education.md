The Consumer Education Department has the critical task of informing and educating consumers about their rights and responsibilities. The department also provides timely and useful information about market developments and related issues.  To best achieve its mandate and expand the Councilâ€™s reach, the department actively engages market executives, Local Government Councils, traditional media organisations, civil society such as Consumer Protection Associations (CPAs), other Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Community Based Organisations (CBOs), as trusted and respected dissemination channels. More recently, and in order to promote efficiency, as well as in recognition of more innovative business strategies to advertise and develop customer loyalty, the department is exploring Business Guidance opportunities to leverage on those strategies and apparatus to educate consumers.
